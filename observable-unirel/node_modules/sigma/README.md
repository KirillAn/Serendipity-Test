[Sigma.js](https://www.sigmajs.org) is an open-source JavaScript library aimed at visualizing graphs of thousands of nodes and edges using WebGL, mainly developed by [@jacomyal](https://github.com/jacomyal) and [@Yomguithereal](https://github.com/Yomguithereal), and built on top of [graphology](https://graphology.github.io/).

## How to use in your project

To integrate sigma into your project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Installation:** Add `sigma` and `graphology` to your project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install sigma graphology
   ```

2. **Usage:** Import sigma into your JavaScript or TypeScript file:

   ```javascript
   import Graph from "graphology";
   import Sigma from "sigma";
   ```

   Then, create a new `Sigma` instance with your graph data and target container:

   ```javascript
   const graph = new Graph();
   graph.addNode("1", { label: "Node 1", x: 0, y: 0, size: 10, color: "blue" });
   graph.addNode("2", { label: "Node 2", x: 1, y: 1, size: 20, color: "red" });
   graph.addEdge("1", "2", { size: 5, color: "purple" });

   const sigmaInstance = new Sigma(graph, document.getElementById("container"));
   ```

## How to develop locally

To run the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jacomyal/sigma.js.git
cd sigma.js
npm install
npm run start
```

This will open the Storybook in your web browser, which live reloads when you modify the stories or the package sources.
